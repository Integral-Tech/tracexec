# General

- Set baseline env from cmdline, which is compared against when diffing env.
- Load env file from cmdline
- Load settings from profile
- Export/Save the data.
  - View the exported data.

# TUI

- Search and filter
- Terminal scrollback support
- Mouse support
- Customizable key bindings
- Confirm message (maybe put this under title or help?) for copy target, quit, etc.
- Better formatting of other events
- Tree mode
- (Maybe) switch to manual rendering by using Notify and batch frequent rerenders.
  - Maybe use an atomic bool to indicate whether to rerender or not. Cancel a scheduled rerender if the bool is false.
- Make the terminal better

# Internal

- Find a way to synchronize the style between TUI and log mode.
- Reduce clones (Lots of clones are happening because of we can't have self-referencing struct. Low priority, the performance is good enough in practice)
