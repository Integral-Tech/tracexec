# General

- Load env file from cmdline

# TUI

- Confirm message (maybe put this under title or help?) for copy target, quit, etc.
- (Maybe) switch to manual rendering by using Notify and batch frequent rerenders.
  - Maybe use an atomic bool to indicate whether to rerender or not. Cancel a scheduled rerender if the bool is false.
- Make the terminal better

# Internal

- Find a way to synchronize the style between TUI and log mode.
- Reduce clones (Lots of clones are happening because of we can't have self-referencing struct. Low priority, the performance is good enough in practice)
