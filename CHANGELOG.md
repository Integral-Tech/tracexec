# Changelog

## v0.1.0

tracexec v0.1.0 is now finally released! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

![tracexec v0.1.0](https://github.com/kxxt/tracexec/blob/main/screenshots/tui-demo.gif?raw=true)

This release includes TUI feature and many improvements and bug fixes.

### Notable changes since v0.0.5

#### Added

- An awesome TUI built with awesome ratatui.
- Tracing and diffing file descriptors to easily catch fd leaks and figure out inherited fds.
  - [Experimental] Try to construct cmdline that reproduces the same fds/stdio. (`--stdio-in-cmdline/--fd-in-cmdline`)
- Add `--user` option to run as a different user.  (This is mostly useful for tracing setuid/setgid binaries. Thanks to strace for the idea.)
  - Automatically disable seccomp-bpf when using `--user` because seccomp-bpf enforces no-new-privs.
- Add `-C` option to change the working directory of tracexec.
- Add `--filter{,-include,-exclude}` and `--show-all-events` option to filter events.
- Warn on bad envp/argv/filename and empty argv.
- TUI: Now tracexec can be themed at compile-time by changing `src/tui/theme.rs`.

#### Fixed

- Fix hang when root child is stopped by other signals before ptrace is setup
- Log mode: The formatting of interpreters now correctly respects color settings(e.g. NO_COLOR).
- Fix the logic of argv[0] handling for both logging and TUI mode.
- Log mode: Don't crash if `tcsetpgrp` returns `ENOTTY`.
- Some typos.

#### Changed

- Use `BTreeMap` to make environment variables sorted and deterministic.
- Internal logs are now logged to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/tracexec/tracexec.log`.
- Tracer thread now is named `tracer`.
- Some colors are changed in log mode.
- `--verbose/--quiet` is removed from CLI. Use `--filter{,-include,-exclude}` and `--show-all-events` instead.
- Log mode: `--show-cmdline` no longer implies `--successful-only`.

#### Other

- Add a few tests and CI.
- Enable LTO for release builds.
- Use `opt-level=1` for debug builds.
